## Generating the parameters of model

Now, the codes can automatically generate the 2.5 level battery model, which describes in the paper : 

*Petricca M, Shin D, Bocca A, Macii A, Macii E, Poncino M. An automated framework for generating variable-accuracy battery models from datasheet information. InLow Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED), 2013 IEEE International Symposium on 2013 Sep 4 (pp. 365-370). IEEE.*

At least two diferent discharge currents profiles are needed for building the 2.5level battery model, one example figure can extract from common battery datasheet like this:

#### Deriving 2.5-level circuit equivalent battery model : run Assignment1.m

The other accurate levels model will be added soon.
